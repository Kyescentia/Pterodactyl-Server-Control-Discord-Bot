# Pterodactyl-Control-Discord-Bot
Just a discord bot that gives you the ability to control your servers (as long as your server provider provides it)

---

- It would be nice if you would give me credit when using this
- This project SHOULD work with no issues. If there's one, open an issue and I will check it out.

---

**WHAT TO NOT DO?**
- host this on the same server with your bot. **I AM NOT JOKING THIS WILL BREAK A LOT OF STUFF**

---

**Instructions**
1. Git Pull or Download the repo to your server
2. Add your [discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) along with your **API Credentials** and your **Host's Panel Link** to the file in **utils > config.py**

3. Navigate to the console and run `pip install -U -r requirements.txt` **(ENSURE YOUR DIRECTORY IS CORRECT BEFORE RUNNING IT)**
4. Run `python main.py` in the console
5. Your bot should be up and running with the commands in place
